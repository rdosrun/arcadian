            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>
                To build a nationwide culture of pride, connection, and belonging through headwear that celebrates every community.
                We want to be the most trusted brand in regional identity, not by following trends, but by creating meaning, honoring craftsmanship, and building real partnerships with the retailers who help tell these stories.
